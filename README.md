# KBE2
This project challenged us with creating an automated system for chair-manufacturing. We based this on KBE which enables us to capture and systematically reuse product and process
engineering knowledge, with the final goal of reducing time and costs of product development. By this we strive to accomplish automation of repetitive and noncreative design tasks.

We made an interface accessible from the web, where customers was able to input wanted dimensions and production engineers could input production limitations. Based on the input, the data is sent to a template DFA file and updated to be displayed in Siemens NX. The project had the goal of automating a process by enabling multiple systems and making them interract with eachother.
